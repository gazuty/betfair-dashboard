# 📊 Betfair Dashboard

This project provides a streamlined way to process Betfair raw results CSV files, consolidate them into a master dataset, and generate Google Sheets + Looker Studio dashboards for easy analysis.

## 🚀 What this project does
- Consolidates raw Betfair results CSV files into a single master file
- Builds summary tables (By Day, By Week, By Month, By Sport, By Country, Track Stats, Strike Rates)
- Exports data to Google Sheets
- Connects to a pre-designed Looker Studio template for professional dashboards

## 📝 Requirements
- Google Account (Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio access)
- Google Colab (or local Python environment)
- Your own folder in Google Drive to store data files
- Raw Betfair results CSV files to process

## ⚙️ How to get started
1️⃣ Place your raw Betfair results CSV files into your chosen Google Drive folder.  
2️⃣ Run the provided Colab notebook (`Results.ipynb`).  
3️⃣ The code will generate and update a master CSV automatically and export data summaries to Google Sheets.  
4️⃣ Use the Looker Studio template below to visualize your data.

## 📊 Betfair Dashboard Looker Studio Template

We've provided a Looker Studio template that you can use to visualize your Betfair data:

👉 [Open the Betfair Looker Studio Template](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/vYrmf16mdp8)

### How to use the template:
1️⃣ Click the link above to open the template.  
2️⃣ In Looker Studio: go to `File → Make a copy`.  
3️⃣ When prompted, connect your own Google Sheet as the data source.  
4️⃣ Your Google Sheet should use the same structure (sheet names and column headers) as generated by this project:
- Sheet names like `By Day`, `By Week`, `By Sport`
- Columns like `Day`, `Profit_Loss`, `Cumulative_Profit_Loss`

⚠️ **Note:** The template uses dummy data — no real betting results are included. Connect your own data to see your results.
