This project analyzes Betfair profit/loss data using Python in Google Colab and visualizes it in Google Sheets.

It is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, with clear steps, while also being easy for **more experienced coders** to follow, review, and contribute to.

The code prioritizes readability, transparency, and clear structure for learning and collaboration.
